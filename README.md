# Employee_Managment
Build an Employee Management System (EMS) that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records. The system will be implemented using HTML for the front-end, CSS for styling, JSP for dynamic web pages, JDBC for database connectivity, and MySQL as the backend database.
